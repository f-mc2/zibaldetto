The groupoid of histories on $M$ is the [free groupoid](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+groupoid) over the category of future-oriented pahts from intervals in the time-set $\mathscr{T}\equiv\mathbb{R}$ in $M$ whose composition is the intuitive one we can pictorially imagine.

When performing the explicit construction, we obtain a branching of the time-set.
