This digital garden is realized using [Obsidian for Linux](https://obsidian.md/) and deployed through [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) by means of the [beautiful plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) by [oleeskild](https://github.com/oleeskild). The content are some random written outputs on topics in Mathematics/Physics by [Florio M. Ciaglia](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8987-1181). Since I am producing this digital garden following the idea of [learning in public](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public), there will be links leading to void notes.These void notes are there because the need to write them stemmed while writing other notes, and I have not yet had the time to write them.
