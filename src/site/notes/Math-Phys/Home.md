This digital garden contains some random written outputs on topics in Mathematics/Physics by [Florio M. Ciaglia](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8987-1181). Since I am producing this GitLab page following the idea of [learning in public](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public), there will be links leading to void notes.These void notes are there because the need to write them stemmed while writing other notes, and I have not yet had the time to write them.
