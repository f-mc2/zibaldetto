How do we define **random experiments**?

To me, a sufficiently clear definition is given in [Cramer's book](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691005478/mathematical-methods-of-statistics-pms-9-volume-9) "Mathematical Methods of Statistics" ([here there is a free version](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.223699)). In the beginning of chapter 13 it is written: 

>In the majority of cases, however, our knowledge is not precise  enough to allow of exact predictions of the results of individual  observations. ... Even if the utmost care is taken to keep all relevant  circumstances under control, the result may in such cases vary from  one observation to another in an irregular way that eludes all our  attempts at prediction. In such a case, we shall say that we are  concerned with a sequence of random experiments.

I like this definition because it is both reasonably **operational** and reasonably **subjective**. It makes no attempt to define a rigorous notion of [randomness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07068)  and then apply it to the dirty world of experimental observations.

All the weight of "randomness" lies on the shoulders of whoever is trying to give a scientific account/explanation of the phenomenon under investigation. Different levels/type of knowledge/understanding may lead to different flavours of randomness. To simplify almost blasphemously, if I do not know that a dice is flawed while Ms. Clamenzia does, our personal accounts of a sequence of tossing of that coin will make use of a different notion of randomness.

I understand there could objections against this point of view, but, at the moment, I did not have sufficient time to neither formulate them nor be exposed to them.
