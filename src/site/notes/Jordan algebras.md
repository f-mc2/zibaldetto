 Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field of characteristic different than $2$. A **Jordan algebra**  over $\mathbb{F}$ is an $\mathbb{F}$-algebra $\mathcal{J}$ whose product, often written as $\{\cdot,\cdot\}$ or $\circ$, satisfies the following properties:

$$ 
\begin{split}

\{x,y\}&=\{y,x\} \\

\{\{x,y\},\{x,x\}\}&=\{x,\{y,\{x,x\}\}\} .

\end{split}

$$

In general, the product is not-associative.

It is customary to write $x^{2}\equiv \{x,x\}$ for all $x\in\mathcal{J}$ and call it the square of $x$. 

A real Jordan algebra $\mathcal{J}$ is called **formally real** if the sum of any $n$ squares in $\mathcal{J}$ vanishes if and only if all the the terms in the sum vanish individually. The  squares elements in a real, formally real Jordan algebra are also called positive **elements**.
